The To-Do list project is being made as part of the The Odin Project curriculum. The main skill I'm working to improve in this lesson is following the Single Responsibility Principle from the SOLID design principles.

Current Features:
 - Add projects to page
 - Delete projects from page
 - Check projects complete
 - Add tasks to projects

Left to do:
 - Personally review code and clean up as best as possible
 - Find a better programmer to review code and take design notes
